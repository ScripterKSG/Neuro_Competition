This repository contains the data files and notebooks used in a Kaggle competition by Rice University. The goal to predict whether a pair of neurons (one axon and one dendrite)
would form a connection (a synapse) and to also determine the most significant features to distinguish a connection. The task was a binary classification problem on a heavily
imbalanced training dataset of over 175,000 False observations and less than 3,000 True observations. 

Against 55 other pairs of contestants made of around 100 students at Rice University, I placed 20th individually.
